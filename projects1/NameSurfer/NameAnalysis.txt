I saw that both of the names that have been increasing popularity (Eduardo and Luis) are both Hispanic names.
This  was interesting because it means that the Hispanic population in the world has been growing and also the influence throughout the whole world is really big. This was even more interesting to me because as a Hispanic myself I would've thought that the most popular names would be Juan or Pedro but it is impressive that both Eduardo and Luis are also very common.
