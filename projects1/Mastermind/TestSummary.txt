Testing the Mastermind class:

CODE: (See mastermind class)

-------
OUTPUT:
Welcome to Mastermind.

This is a text version of the classic board game Mastermind.
The computer will think of a secret code.
The code consists of 4 colored pegs.
The pegs may be one of the following colors: Blue Green Orange Purple Red Yellow

A color may appear more than once in the code.

You try to guess what colored pegs are in the code and what order they are in
After making a guess the result will be displayed.
A result consists of a black peg for each peg you have exactly correct (color an
d position) in your guess.
For each peg in the guess that is the correct color, but is out of position, you
 get a white peg.

Only the first letter of the color is displayed. B for Blue, R for Red, and so f
orth.
When entering guesses you only need to enter the first character of the color as
 a capital letter.

You have 12 guesses to get the answer or you lose the game.
